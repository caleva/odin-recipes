    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This great chilli recipe has to be one of the best dishes to serve to friends for a casual get-together.</p>
    <p>An easy sharing favourite that uses up storecupboard ingredients.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large onion</li>
        <li>1 red pepper</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1 tbsp oil</li>
        <li>1 heaped tsp hot chilli powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>500g lean minced beef</li>
        <li>1 beef stock cube</li>
        <li>400g can chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>Â½ tsp dried marjoram</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare your vegetables. Chop 1 large onion into small dice, about 5mm square. The easiest way to do this is to cut the onion in half from root to tip, peel it and slice each half into thick matchsticks lengthways, not quite cutting all the way to the root end so they are still held together. Slice across the matchsticks into neat dice.</li>
        <li>Cut 1 red pepper in half lengthways, remove stalk and wash the seeds away, then chop. Peel and finely chop 2 garlic cloves.</li>
        <li>Start cooking. Put your pan on the hob over a medium heat. Add 1 tbsp oil and leave it for 1-2 minutes until hot (a little longer for an electric hob).</li>
    </ol>
