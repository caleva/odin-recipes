        <li>100g Parmesan cheese, finely grated</li>
        <li>125g ball of mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the aubergine slices in a colander, sprinkle generously with salt and stand the colander over a bowl for
            15–20 mins to draw out the water.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil and cook the pasta for 8–10 mins, or according to packet
            instructions, until al dente. Drain, drizzle with 1tbsp of the oil, season and toss. Set aside</li>
        <li>Heat another 1tbsp of the oil in a sauté pan over a medium heat and cook the onion, chilli and garlic for
            2–3 mins, stirring. Add the minced beef and cook for another 5–6 mins, until it's browned all over. Add the
            tomato purée and Worcestershire sauce, season, then add the tomatoes and basil.Reduce the heat and simmer
            for 20 mins. Preheat the oven to 190ºC (375ºF, gas mark 5).</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, rinse the salt from the aubergine slices and pat dry with kitchen paper. Pour the remaining oil
            into a large nonstick frying pan or griddle placed over a high heat, and fry or griddle the aubergine for
            1–2 mins on each side until golden brown. You may need to do this in batches.</li>
        <li>Lightly oil a 22 × 28cm (8½ × 11in) deep ovenproof dish. Lay a third of the aubergine into the dish, then
            spread over half the pasta. Add half the cottage cheese, then half the minced beef and a third of the
            Parmesan. Repeat the layers, then finish with the remaining aubergine slices and Parmesan. Arrange the
            mozzarella evenly over the top. Bake for 30 mins, until bubbling around the sides. Serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
